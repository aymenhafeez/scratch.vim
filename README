Overview

You can use the scratch plugin to create a temporary scratch buffer to store
and edit text that will be discarded when you quit/exit vim. The contents
of the scratch buffer are not saved/stored in a file.

Installation

Install with your package manager of choice, or using Vim 8's native plugin support:

      mkdir -p ~/.vim/pack/plugins/start
      cd ~/.vim/pack/plugins/start
      git clone https://github.com/aymenhafeez/scratch.vim

Usage

You can use the following command to open/edit the scratch buffer:

      :Scratch

To open the scratch buffer in a new split window, use the following command:

      :Sscratch

The size of the split scratch buffer can be set using g:split_size. This is set
to 13 by default.

You can set the direction the split scratch buffer opens in using
g:split_direction. This is set to 'aboveleft' by default. Possible options are
in line with Vim'm split commands: vert[ical], lefta[bove], rightb[elow],
to[pleft] and bo[tright]. Where these windows appeal will be influenced by the
'splitbelow' and 'splitright' options; setting this to lefta[above] or
rightb[elow] will overrule 'splitbelow' and 'splitright'.

When you close the scratch buffer window, the buffer will retain the
contents. You can again edit the scratch buffer by openeing it using one of
the above commands. There is no need to save the scatch buffer.

When you quit/exit Vim, the contents of the scratch buffer will be lost.
You will not be prompted to save the contents of the modified scratch
buffer.

You can have only one scratch buffer open in a single Vim instance. If the
current buffer has unsaved modifications, then the scratch buffer will be
opened in a new window.
